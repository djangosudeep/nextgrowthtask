1) Both the Flask and the Django are the python application frameworks.

2)When the application we have to build is a simple application then we can go with the Flask Framework.
    2.a)Because the Flask Framework is very supportive for the simple application.
    2.b)we can add more functionality to the application and can make it as a complex application as well.
    
3)While coming to the Django Framework, It provides many out of box features and reduces time to build complex applications.
    3.a)so when the particular application is a complex one we can go with the Django Framework.

4)When the Requirements has to be changed dynamically, Django Framework is not suitable to build the application. 
    4.a)while in flask we can add more tasks whenever there is change in the requirement.

5)If the time to develop the particular web application is less than we can go with the Django.
    5.a)Because Django comes with a built-in template engine that saves a lot of development time.
    5.b)And the Flask’s template engine Jinja2 is based on Django’s template engine.

6)When we are new to the web application development and we have to choose between Flask and the Django Frameworks, we can Choose Flask.
    6.a)Because With Flask to build some application, you can start with some necessary programming skills.
    6.b)But with the Django, It needs some prior homework for you to write even a Hello World program.

7) Both Flask and the Django has very large programming communities, so we can go with any of them.
